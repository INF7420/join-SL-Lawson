        <h2> Need Library programs? I have just the Thing for you!</h2>
          <p > Some of my earliest memories are of being seated in the little, red rocking chair near the
             fireplace in the Victorian home that housed my hometown's first Public Library. I can
            still hear the tick and chime of the grandfather clock in my memory and feel the texture
            of the just-right-for-my-little-hands Beatrix Potter book. I can still hear the hushed
             tones of my mom talking with the librarian as they discuss the new library being built across the street.</p> 
            <p>The new brick and mortar library across from the original location would be where I would
            get my first taste of Public Library work more than twenty years later. The grandfather clock
          and Beatrix Potter books were still there. The Librarian from my memory had retired years before but
        the memory of her enthusiasm for all things library remained. From material selection to programming 
        and everything in between, I was in charge of the Children's Department. Programming soon became a 
        favorite part of my job and a popular activity for local families. </p> 
          <p>Some years later I moved on to work in a small, rural Carnegie library in Essex, Iowa. With a 
            staff of two, the Director and me, we shared most of the jobs. If there was a library job to do, 
          I probably did it. Programming for everyone from babies to teens. I loved coming up with just the right thing to do!
          </p> 

            <p>Currently I am working at Pontiac Public Library at the Circulation Desk. Before circulation I was Youth Services Library Assistant.
              I was given the opportunity to plan and implement several Youth Services programs and help with and advertise many more. While there
               are many other library tasks and skills that I am able to do, there is no topping programming! Photos, videos and more detailed 
               information about my work is located throughout this website.
