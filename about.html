             <h2>Education</h2>    
             <p class="list-content2p"> In January of 2019 I started the pursuit of my Master of Library and Information Sciences at 
               <a href="https://sis.wayne.edu"> Wayne State University's School of Information Science.</a> Although I have 
               strong interests in Youth Librarianship, both my interests and coursework covers a broad spectrum of Librarianship topics. 
               I am an active member of the Student Chapter of the American Library Association. <br>
                My Bachelor of Science in Early Childhood Studies was obtained at <a href="https://rc.edu"> Rochester University.</a> It is 
                the school so nice that I went there twice! I had received an Associate in Arts degree from there years before.

              <h2>Experience</h2>  
              <p class="list-content2p">  Most of my library experience has been in the Youth Services Departments. I have worked in 
                small town, rural and urban libraries and have loved them all.  Whether ordering books and supplies, speaking to a 
                group of parents or a philanthropic organization, or planning, promoting, and implementing fun, exciting, and relevant p
                rograms, or anything in between, I love what I do! Currently I am working in the Circulation Department while pursuing my MLIS. 
                I still run the Family Karaoke Night once a month</p>

                <p class="list-content2p"> My personal interests are reading, writing, and spending time with my family. We enjoy binge
                   watching anime and other shows together, playing games (video and board games), Pokemon GO! and more. I am a Ravenclaw, 
                   Whovian, combat the Dark Side, and am passionate about slow cooking. I am a Alto II in the <a href="https://www.rcalumnichorus.org/"> Rochester 
                   College Alumni Chorus </a> which starts it's 4th season this fall.   </p>
